# Loki

This is our demo repository which is published with the [tutorial blogpost](https://liquidreply.net/an-introduction-to-loki).
It contains a loki.yaml which can be used to set up a working loki-system in distributed-mode.

# Usage

Just install the grafana/loki-distributed helm-chart with the loki.yaml custom-values.
